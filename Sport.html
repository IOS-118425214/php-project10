            <p>From a very young age I was extremely interested in the game of basketball. I was fascinated by the fast pace and amount of team work needed on both ends of the court. At the age of five I started playing in my primary school for fun. Once I turned eleven I joined my local basketball club, Glanmire and was able to start competing at an underage level. I trained at least three times a week. As well as playing underage I also played for the Womenâ€™s Division 1 team and was the Captain of my school team for 3 years.  On top of training I enjoyed coaching The Academy which included players between the ages of 10-12. </p>

            <p>Winning the Cork county championship 5 times at an underage level for my club is one of my biggest achievements. </p>
