        <h2>Inter Railing 2018</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>If there is one holiday that I believe everyone should experience in their lifetime it would be to go inter railing around Europe. On the 28th of June 2018, six days after I had finished my Leaving Cert, five of my closest friends and I flew to Amsterdam in the Netherlands to begin our four-week journey. </p>
            <h6>We spent three days each in four cities;</h6>
                    <ul>
                            <li>Amsterdam</li>
                            <li>Berlin</li>
                            <li>Prague</li>
                            <li>Budapest</li>
                    </ul>
            <p> We then travelled to Split in Croatia on a five-hour train from Budapest where we spent six days on the beach recovering in the sun from the hectic cities. I must admit we did cheat slightly by flying from Split to Marbella where we enjoyed our last two weeks with our friendâ€™s family.  </p>
